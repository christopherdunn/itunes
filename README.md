Project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Started with the iTunes rss feed for the Top 100 songs as the basis for building a web app to display the list in fun creative format.

V1:
Get the basic styling done, ie. make it look like the iTunes app.
Have the page display the Top 100 explicit songs from iTunes downloads.

To run:
1. Download the repo
2. yarn start and you're off and running.
